               <h2>How I would fare in the future</h2>
               <p> So I was given a scenario where in the event of an apocalypse,
                   if we only had $1200, what would we buy to survive? This is sort of a preperation for the worse about what
                   might happen with the corona virus epidemic and the current economy meltdown. 
                   I think many may agree that the most important things to get with the money are essentials and then the rest should be saved.
